This repository contains a demonstration of a common, yet subtle, error in COBOL programs involving array indexing and variable scope within PERFORM loops. The `bug.cob` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version. The error stems from an incorrect understanding of how variable scope and array access work in nested structures. This example highlights the importance of carefully managing variable scope, especially when using loops and arrays in COBOL.
